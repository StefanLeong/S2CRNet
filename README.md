<i>Image harmonization aims to modify the color of the composited region with respect to the specific background. Previous works model this task as a pixel-wise image-to-image translation using UNet family structures. However, the model size and computational cost limit the performability of their models on edge devices and higher-resolution images. To this end, we propose a novel spatial-separated curve rendering network(S<sup>2</sup>CRNet) for efficient and high-resolution image harmonization for the first time. In S<sup>2</sup>CRNet, we firstly extract the spatial-separated embeddings from the thumbnails of the masked foreground and background individually. Then, we design a curve rendering module(CRM), which learns and combines the spatial-specific knowledge using linear layers to generate the parameters of the pixel-wise curve mapping in the foreground region. Finally, we directly render the original high-resolution images using the learned color curve. Besides, we also make two extensions of the proposed framework via the Cascaded-CRM and Semantic-CRM for cascaded refinement and semantic guidance, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed method reduces more than 90% parameters compared with previous methods but still achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthesized iHarmony4 and real-world DIH test set. Moreover, our method can work smoothly on higher resolution images in real-time which is more than 10Ã— faster than the existing methods. </i>
